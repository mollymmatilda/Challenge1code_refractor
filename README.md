## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project.

- What was your motivation? I wanted to create a codebase that follows accessability standards to make the webpage ADA compliant.
- Why did you build this project? I built this project to allow people with disabilities to view and navigate the webpage with relative ease.
- What problem does it solve? I changed the syntax in the code to make it semantic as well as added a new line of code that enables clients to click a link at the top of the page that will then take them directly to the corresponding section.
- What did you learn? I learned how to change certain syntax to make it ADA compliant. I also learned how to create a link that takes the client to a specific part of the webpage.
